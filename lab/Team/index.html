          I am currently a master’s student in the Computer Science Department at Saint Louis University. I graduated from Sreyas Institute of Engineering and Technology which is affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University with an 8.74 GPA. During this period, I learned the fundamentals of programming. I was introduced to “C Language”, where I started diving into the world of Programming. My enthusiasm for coding grew as I began to study new programming languages. I was able to obtain a “Cisco C certificate. I was also honored with HTML5, CSS, Java script, Python, and Python data structures certification. My paper "Object Detection using Voice Sensor and Cartoonizing the Image" was published in the International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering. I completed a Data Visualization internship as Data Analyst powered by “Excelerate”. In order to gain pragmatic experience, I joined Accenture Solutions Private Limited. As an Application Development Associate in Accenture Solutions Private Limited, I was trained in Manual and Automation Testing including selenium, Unified Functional Testing, Cucumber, JMeter. My perspectives have been enlarged by working with these technologies. I find pleasure in pursuing a range of interests, such as painting, sketching with pencils, composing poetry, and dancing.
